    <h2 id=subheading-1>SSHGui</h2>

<h3 id=blog-text><span>In my previous posts I have outlined two examples of servers that I have set up on my home network. However, connecting to them, and to any other machine would require typing out the
full ssh command in my terminal. I decided to attempt to implement an alternative by creating a simple app that would display a list of all of my servers, and allow me simply select
which one to connect to and then open my terminal of choice connected to my remote server.</h3>

<h3 id=blog-text>Prior to SSHGui, I have been using Zig for all of my programming projects, but for this app I decided I would try something new. I had heard and seen the extent to which Java is
used in enterprise software, along with its mature ecosystem and broad userbase, and despite the negative connotations regarding the language, I chose it as the language for this
application. Using Java was much simpler than using Zig as searching online for solutions to problems yeilded results with much greater consistency and accuracy. Along with this Java
allows for functions to hang off variables which makes using the language much more fluent than in Zig where this is not the case.</h3>

<h3 id=blog-text>My first attempt at writing a real program in Java, was a basic program to just launch an application window. Like most things throughout the SSHGui project, finding an answer to how
I would go about this was not a difficult task. I had discovered the awt library to open and control application windows using text, lists, and options, and in no time I had a
&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; window open, along with lists and options which functioned as one would expect.</h3>

<h3 id=blog-text>After configuring the sizing of the window and the list, and the position of the list I was ready to start actually working out how I would actually make this application happen.
I had discovered that using a KeyListener, I could define logic to be executed when the user pressed the specified key within the component the listener was listening too.
I used the KeyListener to detct the Enter, Control+n, and Control+p keybindings, for selection, moving down the list and moving up the list respectively (the list had native support
for arrow key navigation).</h3>

<h3 id=blog-text>Despite my progress up to this point I was still missing the fundamental aspect that would decide if this application was going to work at all, the connection to the servers
themselves. Thankfully again I needn&rsquo;t look far before I found the answer I was looking for, the Runtime.getRuntime().exec() function. This function would allow me to run any terminal
command as another process on my machine, and using the -e argument when launching my terminal, I was able to open a SSH connection directly through the list when an option was
selected.</h3>

<h3 id=blog-text>Now the program functioned how I had hoped it would but I knew there was still improvements that could be made. At the moment I was manually specifing the amount of servers, the server
addresses, the names of each server and the terminal that would be used to launch the SSH connection. With the help of Opencode to point out flaws in my implementation, I was able to
construct two functions to read a config file that would specify which terminal, what servers would be used, and what their names would be displayed as within the list and then pass
those outputs to the Runtime.getRuntime().exec() function directly, which allows for any terminal (that allows for the -e flag to run a command as the terminal opens - sorry Powershell
users) and any number of servers to be specified.</h3>

<h3 id=blog-text>SSHGui now worked as I had fully intended, however there was one part of the project that still needed refining, and that was the runner script. I had been using this basic shell
script to make running the program easier and more accessible on other linux systems. As I was using the Sway window manager, I also used the &ldquo;dotool&rdquo; application to make the SSHGui
window into floating mode as soon as it opened within the runner script, it also defines necessary environment variables for systems such as debain which require them to open awt
applications.</h3>

<h3 id=blog-text>Overall SSHGui has greatly improved my ability to connect to my local machines to managage and configure them as need be and I hope that it will continue to for myself and others into
the future.</h3>
